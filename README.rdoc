# React Todo

This is my take on the TodoMVC [todoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/).

## To use

There is a simple server implementations included, which serves static files from `public/` and handle requests to `/api/todo` to fetch or add data. Start theserver with one the following:

### Ruby
```sh
ruby server.rb
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
